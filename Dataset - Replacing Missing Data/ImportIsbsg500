We imported the ISBSG random sample of 500 projects, isbsg500, into the isbsgorig database in MySQL.
The isbsg500 sample contains 500 rows and 16 columns. The first column is the project identifier, ProyID, 
and the remaining 15 columns serve as study variables. For numeric variables, blank values were replaced 
with -1 value to facilitate SQL queries.
