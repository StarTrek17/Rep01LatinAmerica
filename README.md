Resources and extra documentation for the manuscript "Replacing Missing Data" published in IEEE Latin America Transactions. The code is organized by the type of process:
•	Pre-processing: MySql;
•	Predictions Model: R;
•	Other algorithms to predict: Excell.
________________________________________
Dataset and subsets
The database files are in the folder "Dataset - Replacing Missing Data in a Set of Historical Projects". In this folder, you will find the references to original ISBSG database, the subsets used for training process in the "Training T-Subset" folder. The subset is in txt format for copying and pasting into the code.
Codes
Pré processing
The code for preprocessing is in the folder "MySql - Pre-processing code," where you can find the script used to prepare the database for use in the MySql process. In this Mysql notebook, you just need to use the previously described CSV T-subset and V-subset.
Predict
The prediction codes are in two folders: "R - Algorithms for prediction model" which contains the effort prediction models using R, and "Excell - Algorithms for other predictions," which contains the calculus for MMRE, PRED(25)  and MAE validation metrics.
